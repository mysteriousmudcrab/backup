A simple Ruby Backup class utilising rsync to only backup files that have 
changed.  If a file is deleted locally, it will also be deleted from the backup.
This Backup class performs a small test backup to determine if the backup fails.
If it fails, the most likely reason is if the destination is FAT32/NTFS.
In this case, compatibility mode is used to attempt the backup (meaning some
file permissions, dates, etc. will not be preserved).

A prompt appears before the backup starts, giving the user a chance to verify 
config (if in verbose mode).
A sample main.rb file is included for usage and instantiating the class.

Multiple destinations can be specified:  the first available will be used.
A brief check of each backup location is checked for accessibility.
If all destinations are inaccessable, the backup will abort.

The following output is a sample run.
The first backup destination is not available here, so the second is 
automatically selected (/windows/backup).  Note that in this run the test 
backup fails because the destination is NTFS, activating compatibility mode.
