A simple Ruby backup class utilising rsync to only backup files that have changed.
If a file is deleted locally, it will be also removed from the backup (see example run).
A prompt appears before the backup starts, giving the user a chance to verify config (if in verbose mode).
A sample main.rb file is included for usage and instantiating the class.

Multiple destinations can be specified:  the first available will be used.
A brief check of each backup location is checked for accessibility.  If inaccessable, a warning will appear but backup will still proceed.

The following output is a sample run.  The first backup destination is not available here, so the second is automatically selected (/windows/backup).
Note that in this run the test backup fails because the destination is NTFS, activating compatibility mode - which does not preserve unix filesystem details such as permissions, dates, owner, group, etc.
